This Privacy Policy describes how Roblox UGC Creator (the "App") collects, uses, and shares information.

## 1) Information We Collect
We collect the following categories of information:
- **Account information**: Email address and basic profile fields from Supabase Auth.
- **Roblox OAuth data**: Roblox user ID, username, avatar URL, and OAuth tokens.
- **User content**: AI prompts, generated 3D assets, textures, and related metadata.
- **Usage data**: Basic logs about feature usage and job status updates.

## 2) How We Use Information
We use your information to:
- Provide authentication and account access.
- Generate 3D assets using AI providers.

## 3) Third-Party Services
We use third-party services to deliver core functionality:
- **Supabase** for authentication, database, and storage.

These providers process data only to deliver the requested services.

## 4) Data Retention
